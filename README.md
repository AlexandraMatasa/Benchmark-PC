Benchmark-PC 🖥️📊⏱️

A system performance testing tool developed in C++ that evaluates various hardware components through customized benchmarks.

✨ What It Does
- Analyzes CPU specifications and frequency.

- Evaluates memory capacity and access speed.

- Tests arithmetic and logical performance using: Huffman coding, Monte Carlo Pi estimation, Bit manipulation, Taylor series for exponential calculation.

- Measures I/O performance and memory transfer speed.

- Aggregates all results into a final benchmark score.

- Exposes results to a Python-based GUI via Pybind11.
  

📌 Highlights
- Accurate timing via std::chrono for nanosecond precision.

- Modular design: each test is a separate C++ module.

- Cross-language functionality using Pybind11.

- Designed for systems evaluation and performance comparison.
